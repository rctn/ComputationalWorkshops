## A tutorial on using Git, Github, and Python

Included are files from the first event in the Spring 2017 Redwood Workshop Series. This workshop held on 1/25/16 at Redwood has inforamtion about getting started using Git, Github, and an intro to basic Python for those with some programming experience in other languages such as Matlab. To be able to complete the tutorial, you should:  
    1. Have a basic grasp of programming in some language (if not you can run through at least some of  https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)
    2. Make a free GitHub account at https://github.com/join
    3. Follow the instructions in the attached PDF from VS265 to make a clean install of Anaconda Python3 (NOT Python 2.x), Jupyter Notebooks, and Numpy on your laptop. Ignore the part about ffmpeg. (Even if you already have some of these installed please follow these instructions so we'll all be working on the same platform!)

The pdf "Python_Install" has instructions on installing Anaconda Python needed to follow the tutorials included here. It is taken from the VS265 course taught through the Redwood, and the FFMPEG installation instructions can be ignored for the purposes of this tututorial.

The pdf "Gitting started with GIT" highlights reasons to use Git as a software management and collaboration tool, as well as the basics in making and cloning a repo. 

The Jupyter Notebook "Intro to Python & GitHub" gives some introduction on why to use Python, basics about it's differences between other languages such as MatLab, and gives examples on how to spin up a notebook and import and use some useful packages such as numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and scipy, as well as some basic debugging with Pydb.
