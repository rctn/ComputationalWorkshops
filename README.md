## Computational Workshop Tutorials 

Included are files from the Spring 2017 Redwood Workshop Series. These workshops held at Redwood in January & Februrary 2017. These workshops so far are:  

	1.  Git/Github and Introductory Python  
	2.  Tensorflow   
	3.  Using the Cluster Resources at Redwood
 
Each subfolder in this directory contains the materials for each respective workshop in the series.   

The pdf "Python_Install" has instructions on installing Anaconda Python needed to follow the tutorials included here. It is taken from the VS265 course taught through the Redwood, and the FFMPEG installation instructions can be ignored for the purposes of this tututorial.
